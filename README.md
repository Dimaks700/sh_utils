# sh_utils

Hi! Here you can see the full implementation of grep and cat in C.
The project is built using a Makefile
For testing, I used Bash scripts, redirecting the output of my own and original utilities to a file and comparing via diff
Grep supports flags in all combinations: -e, -i, -v, -c, -l, -n, -h, -s, -f, -o.
The cat supports flags in all combinations: -n, -b, -s, -e, -t, -v.
